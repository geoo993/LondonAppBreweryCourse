/*
 There is no implicit type casting in Swift. The above 
 while clause will not work without converting max to an
 Int or count to a UInt8. 
 
 To convert a type to another type, use the new type's 
 constructor, for example UInt8(count) or Int(max).
 
 This points out that "primitive" types in Swift are
 implemented as class types.
