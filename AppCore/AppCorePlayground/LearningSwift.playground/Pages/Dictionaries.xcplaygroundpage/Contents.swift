//A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, in which
//All of the keys are the same type, and 
//All the values are the same type.
//The type of the keys must be "hashable", hashable means that there is a way for each key to be uniquely represented.
//the good news is, all swift primitive types are hashable, such as String, Int, Double, Float and Bool (allong with all of their subtypes like Uint16, Uint, Int32 etc...)

intNames[42] = "forty two"
intNames[6] = "six"
intNames[7] = "seven"
intNames[27] = "seven"

//these values are added as optionals:
print("\(intNames[42]) divided by \(intNames[6]) equals \(intNames[42/6])")

//use explicit unwrapping:
print("\(intNames[42]!) divided by \(intNames[6]!) equals \(intNames[42/6]!)")

    return value == "seven"

//remove all elements:
intNames = [:]

//add another element with key -5, as this is not index you can do negative
intNames[-5] = "negative five"
